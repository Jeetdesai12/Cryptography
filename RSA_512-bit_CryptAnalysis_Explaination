RSA Explaination and Cryptanalysis:

RSA Encryption and Decryption Basics:

1. Key Generation:

First, we will choose two big prime numbers `p` and `q` randomly.
These primes are used to compute a number `n = p * q`, which is used as the modulus for both the public and private keys.
We also calculate a value called Euler’s totient `phi(n) = (p-1)*(q-1)`, which helps in generating the keys.
   
2. Public Key and Private Key:

The public key consists of the number `e` and the modulus `n`. The private key is the number `d`, which is the modular inverse of `e` with respect to `phi(n)`. 
To find `d`, we use a mathematical method called the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   
   How Extended Euclidean Algorithm Works:

   The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is a method used to find the modular inverse of `e` with respect to `phi(n)`. The basic Euclidean Algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The extended version also computes the coefficients (often called `x` and `y`) that satisfy the equation:
   `e * x + phi(n) * y = gcd(e, phi(n))`.
   
   In RSA, we want to find `d`, which is the modular inverse of `e` modulo `phi(n)`. This means we need to find `d` such that:
   `e * d ≡ 1 (mod phi(n))`.
   
   Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we compute the greatest common divisor of `e` and `phi(n)`, and at the same time, we find the coefficient `d` (modular inverse). If `gcd(e, phi(n)) = 1`, then the modular inverse `d` exists and is used as the private key.

3. Encryption and Decryption:
   Encryption: When you want to send a secure message, you encrypt it using the public key. The encrypted message is calculated as `message^e % n`.
   Decryption: The recipient can decrypt the message using their private key by calculating `cipher^d % n`. The clever part is that, because of the math behind RSA, only the recipient can decrypt the message, even though anyone can encrypt it with the public key.

Cryptanalysis (How RSA Security Works):

1. The Security of RSA:
RSA’s security is based on the difficulty of factoring a large number `n` into its prime factors `p` and `q`. If someone could easily factor `n`, they could compute `p` and `q` and, from there, break the encryption.
The reason RSA works is that factoring large numbers is really hard. For example, if you have a large number with hundreds of digits, there are no known fast ways to break it apart into its prime factors. This is what makes RSA secure.

2. Key Size Matters:
RSA is only as secure as the size of the key. A small key size, like 512 bits, is easily breakable with modern computing power. This is why today, 2048-bit keys or higher are recommended for secure encryption.
The larger the key, the harder it is to factor `n`. For instance, a 2048-bit key has a modulus `n` that is a 617-digit number, which is extremely difficult to factor using current technology.

3. Discrete Logarithm Problem:
RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, but other encryption systems, like Diffie-Hellman and ElGamal, are based on a different hard problem called the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP).
In DLP, the task is to find the exponent in an equation like `g^x ≡ h (mod p)`. While both RSA and DLP are based on hard problems, they are different ways of ensuring encryption security.

Cryptanalysis on Key Components:

1. Key Size and Security:
The key size is one of the most critical factors in RSA's security. Larger key sizes are exponentially harder to crack due to the difficulty of factoring large numbers. 
`p` and `q` are the two prime numbers used to compute the modulus `n`. The size of `p` and `q` directly affects the security of the encryption. If `p` and `q` are too small (for example, if they are 256-bit primes), it becomes possible to factor `n` and break the encryption.
Typically, RSA key sizes of 2048 bits or higher are recommended. A 2048-bit RSA key implies that `n` will have approximately 617 digits, making it significantly harder to factor. In contrast, a 512-bit RSA key is considered insecure because modern algorithms can easily factor numbers of this size.

2. The Role of `e`:
The public exponent `e` is an important parameter in the RSA algorithm. It is typically chosen to be a small prime number like 3 or 65537. This ensures that encryption is fast because smaller exponents result in fewer computational operations.
However, `e` must also be chosen so that it is coprime with `phi(n)`. In other words, `gcd(e, phi(n))` should be 1. If `e` shares a factor with `phi(n)`, it will not be possible to compute the private key `d`.

3. The Role of `d` (Private Key):
The private key `d` is calculated as the modular inverse of `e` modulo `phi(n)`. This means that `e * d ≡ 1 (mod phi(n))`. The value of `d` is critical for the decryption process.
The security of the private key `d` depends on the difficulty of computing the modular inverse. In theory, `d` is always a large number, and in practice, it can be quite large, especially when `n` is large. 
For small key sizes, the value of `d` can be computed relatively easily. However, with larger key sizes (2048 bits or more), the value of `d` becomes computationally hard to determine, which strengthens the security of RSA.

4. The Role of `p` and `q` (Prime Factors):
The two primes `p` and `q` are essential in generating the modulus `n` and the totient `phi(n)`. If an attacker can find these primes, they can easily compute the private key `d` and break the encryption.
The primes `p` and `q` should be sufficiently large and chosen randomly to ensure that `n` is difficult to factor. The prime numbers must also be kept secret because if `p` and `q` are revealed, the entire RSA encryption scheme becomes compromised.
A strong cryptographic system ensures that the prime numbers `p` and `q` are generated randomly and are large enough to resist factoring attacks. A typical size for `p` and `q` in secure RSA implementations is around 1024 bits each, resulting in a 2048-bit key size.
